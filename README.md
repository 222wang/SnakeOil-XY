# SnakeOil XY

Small size, affordable and fast CoreXY 3D printer. Inspired by [HevORT](https://miragec79.github.io/HevORT/), [Voron](https://vorondesign.com/), [Annex Engineering](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering) and [EVA2](https://main.eva-3d.page/) design.  
This project was started as [HevORT lite](https://github.com/ChipCE/HevORT-lite), a trimdown design based on [HevORT corexy](https://miragec79.github.io/HevORT/) 3D printer. In the process of trying to make the printer easier to enclosure, parts easier to print without support, I ended up with redesigned all of the parts.

<code>The first release ETA is scheduled on the end of August 2021.</code>
